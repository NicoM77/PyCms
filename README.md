# Welcome to My CMS

Hello and welcome!

This is my CMS. Itâ€™s not the prettiest CMS, but with a bit of effort, it gets the job done.  
I created it as a way to learn Python, and maybe someone out there would like to further develop it.  
Although, to be honest, starting fresh might be faster and more efficient.

The CMS is accessible at: `/cms`

```bash
python main.py

# This will start a web server that listens on port 5000.
# More details will be available in the console.
```
Enjoy exploring!
